//software FIFO in a basic C program
char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
int inIdx, outIdx;
inIdx = 0;
outIdx = 0;

//enqueue first character from char *string
buffer[inIdx] = *string; //copy character
inIdx++;
inIdx %= BUFFER_SIZE;string++;

//Writes into FIFO will be done by application
//enqueue

//IF buffer empty, then directly send first char to UART 
//Reason: DataInReady high so need to directly send first char
//to UART (32'h80000008)





//Reads from FIFO will be done by ISR
